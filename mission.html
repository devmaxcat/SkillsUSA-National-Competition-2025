                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p>What started as a small family garden has grown into a thriving community hub that serves hundreds of families while maintaining our commitment to sustainable practices and community service.

                    Founded in 2018 by a group of local families concerned about food security and environmental impact, our farm began as a cooperative effort to grow fresh produce for our own tables. As word spread about our methods and mission, neighbors began asking if they could purchase our surplus vegetables.
                    
                    Today, we operate a full farm-to-table restaurant, offer educational programming, and maintain partnerships with local schools and senior centers. Every decision we make is guided by our core question: "How can this benefit our community and our environment?"
                    
                    We're proud to have donated over 15,000 meals to community members in need and to have taught sustainable growing practices to hundreds of families throughout our region.</p>
